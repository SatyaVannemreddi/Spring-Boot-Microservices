# Spring-Boot-Microservices
Microservices architecture using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud 

Microservices is an architectural style that decomposes an application into a smaller, independent, and loosely coupled 
modules. Individual modules are responsible for highly defined and discrete tasks and communicate with other modules through 
simple, universally accessible APIs. This architecture enables the continuous delivery/deployment of large, complex 
applications.

<b>Pros</b>

1. Microservice are relatively small, easy to understand for developers.
2. Independent and parallel development makes project delivery fast.
3. Failue of one service doesnâ€™t cause to bring down the entire application.
4. Each service can be developed and deployed independently.
5. Flexibility to choose right technology for each service based on business requirement.
6. Easier to scale up/down based on the load.
7. Makes use of full CPU power.

<b>Cons</b>

1. Decomposing big application into meaningful services is a complex task.
2. Increased effort for operations, deployment and monitoring
3. Testing a microservices-based application can be cumbersome
4. Multiple databases and transaction management can be difficult to manage.
